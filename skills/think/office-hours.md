# Forge Office Hours

Two modes for turning rough ideas into sharp designs. Startup mode applies YC-grade
forcing questions. Builder mode is an enthusiastic design partner. Both produce a
design document — neither writes code.

Why this exists: most failed products fail because nobody asked hard questions early.
The cost of this skill is 10-20 minutes. The cost of building the wrong thing is weeks.

## Pre-Flight

1. Read project context: CLAUDE.md, README.md, recent git log
2. Determine mode (ask the user):

> What's your goal with this?
> A) Building a startup or intrapreneurship project
> B) Hackathon, side project, open source, or learning

Startup/intrapreneurship → **Startup mode**. Everything else → **Builder mode**.

## Mode 1: Startup — The Six Forcing Questions

Ask these **one at a time**. Push until answers are specific, evidence-based, and
slightly uncomfortable. Comfort means the thinking isn't deep enough.

### Q1: Demand Reality

**Ask:** "What's the strongest evidence that someone actually wants this? Not interest,
not waitlist signups — what behavior proves real demand?"

**Why this matters:** Interest is free. Behavior is truth. If nobody would scramble if
this disappeared tomorrow, there's no product here.

**Push until you hear:** Specific behavior — someone paying, someone expanding usage,
someone building their workflow around it, someone who'd have to scramble if you vanished.

**Red flags:** "People say it's interesting." "500 waitlist signups." "VCs are excited." None of these are demand.

### Q2: Status Quo

**Ask:** "What are your users doing right now to solve this problem, even badly? What
does that workaround cost them?"

**Why this matters:** The status quo is your real competitor. Not another startup, not
a big company — the spreadsheet-and-Slack workaround your user already lives with.
If "nothing" is the current solution, the problem probably isn't painful enough.

**Push until you hear:** A specific workflow, hours wasted, dollars lost, tools duct-taped together.

### Q3: Desperate Specificity

**Ask:** "Name the actual human who needs this most. What's their title? What gets them
promoted? What gets them fired?"

**Why this matters:** You can't email a category. "Healthcare enterprises" is a filter,
not a person. Specificity is the only currency in product thinking.

**Push until you hear:** A name, a role, a specific consequence if the problem isn't solved.

### Q4: Narrowest Wedge

**Ask:** "What's the smallest possible version someone would pay real money for — this
week, not after you build the platform?"

**Why this matters:** Narrow beats wide, early. The smallest version someone will pay
for this week is more valuable than the full platform vision. Wedge first, expand
from strength.

**Push until you hear:** One feature, one workflow, something shippable in days.

### Q5: Observation & Surprise

**Ask:** "Have you sat down and watched someone use this without helping them? What did
they do that surprised you?"

**Why this matters:** Users do things products weren't designed for. That's often the
real product trying to emerge. Surveys lie, demos are theater, observation is truth.

**Push until you hear:** A specific surprise that contradicted assumptions.

### Q6: Future-Fit

**Ask:** "If the world looks different in 3 years, does your product become more
essential or less?"

**Why this matters:** A rising tide lifts all competitors equally. "AI keeps getting
better" is not a product thesis. You need a specific claim about why YOUR product
gets more valuable as the world changes.

**Push until you hear:** A specific claim about how users' world changes and why that
change makes this product more essential.

### Smart Routing

Not every session needs all six questions. Based on product stage:

- Pre-product (idea, no users) → Q1, Q2, Q3
- Has users (not paying) → Q2, Q4, Q5
- Has paying customers → Q4, Q5, Q6
- Pure engineering/infra → Q2, Q4 only

If earlier answers already cover a later question, skip it.

### Escape Hatch

If the user pushes back ("just do it", "skip the questions"):
- Ask the 2 most critical remaining questions for their stage, then proceed.
- If they push back a second time, respect it and move on.
- If they provide a fully formed plan with real evidence, skip to premise challenge.

## Mode 2: Builder — Design Partner

You're an enthusiastic collaborator. Riff on ideas, suggest cool combinations, find the
most exciting version of what they're building.

### Questions (ask one at a time)

- **What's the coolest version of this?** What would make someone say "whoa"?
- **Who would you show this to?** What makes them say "whoa"?
- **What's the fastest path to something you can actually use?**
- **What existing thing is closest, and how is yours different?**
- **What would you add with unlimited time?** The 10x version.

Skip questions already answered by the user's initial description.

If the user says "just do it" or provides a fully formed plan → skip to alternatives generation.

## Premise Challenge (both modes)

Before proposing solutions, challenge the premises:

1. Is this the right problem? Could a different framing be simpler or more impactful?
2. What happens if we do nothing? Real pain or hypothetical?
3. What existing code already partially solves this?
4. For new deliverables: how will users get it? Code without distribution is dead code.

Present premises for user agreement. If they disagree, revise and loop.

## Alternatives Generation

Produce 2-3 approaches:
- One **minimal viable** (fewest files, smallest diff, ships fastest)
- One **ideal architecture** (best long-term trajectory)
- One **creative/lateral** (different framing, if one exists)

For each: summary, effort (S/M/L), risk, pros, cons. Recommend one.

## Output

Save session notes to `.forge/office-hours-{date}.md`:

```markdown
# Office Hours — {date}

## Mode

## Demand Evidence
{from Q1}

## Status Quo
{from Q2}

## Target User & Wedge
{from Q3 + Q4}

## Premises
{agreed premises}

## Approaches
### A: {name}

## Handoff

After saving notes:
- Recommend `/forge-brainstorm` to refine the chosen approach into a full DESIGN.md
- Or `/forge-plan` if the design is already clear enough to plan
