# taku-debug — 4-Phase Root Cause Investigation

Random fixes create new bugs. Systematic investigation finds root causes. This skill merges the best of Superpowers' systematic debugging with gstack's investigate workflow into a unified 4-phase process.

## When to Use This Skill

Use `taku-debug` when:

- the VERIFY phase fails and the failure path is not yet understood
- the user reports broken behavior, a regression, or an intermittent issue
- you need to explain why something is failing before proposing the fix

Do not use `taku-debug` just to run routine verification. Run the repo's normal checks first. Enter this skill when those checks fail or when production behavior is already broken.

## The Iron Law

**NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST.**

Every fix that doesn't address root cause makes the next bug harder to find. If you haven't completed Phase 1 (INVESTIGATE), you cannot propose fixes. Period.

Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.

## The 4 Phases

### Phase 1: INVESTIGATE

Gather context before forming any hypothesis. This is evidence collection, not problem-solving.

**Why evidence-first:** Jumping to solutions before understanding the problem is the single most common debugging failure. You fix what you think is wrong, not what's actually wrong. Evidence-first prevents this bias.

1. **Read the error.** Stack traces, error messages, log output. Read them completely. Line numbers, file paths, error codes — all of it. The error message usually contains the answer.

2. **Reproduce consistently.** What are the exact steps? Does it happen every time? If not reproducible, gather more data. Don't guess at intermittent bugs.

3. **Check recent changes.**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -20 -- <affected-files>
   git diff HEAD~1 -- <affected-files>
   ```
   Was this working before? What changed? A regression means the root cause is in the diff.

4. **Trace data flow backward.** Where does the bad value originate? What called this function with the bad value? Keep tracing up until you find the source. Fix at source, not at symptom.

5. **Gather evidence in multi-component systems.** When the system has layers (API → service → database), add diagnostic logging at each boundary. Run once. See WHERE it breaks. Then investigate THAT layer.

Output: **Root cause hypothesis** — a specific, testable claim about what is wrong and why.

### Phase 2: PATTERN

Match the bug against known patterns before proposing solutions.

**Why pattern-match first:** Most bugs are instances of well-known failure modes. Recognizing the pattern tells you where to look and what to check, cutting investigation time from hours to minutes. Novel bugs are rare; your bug has almost certainly happened before.

| Pattern | Signature | Where to look |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Race condition | Intermittent, timing-dependent | Shared state, concurrent access |
| Null propagation | TypeError, NoMethodError | Missing guards on optional values |
| State corruption | Inconsistent data, partial updates | Transactions, callbacks, hooks |
| Integration failure | Timeout, unexpected response | API boundaries, service calls |
| Config drift | Works locally, fails elsewhere | Env vars, feature flags, secrets |
| Stale cache | Shows old data | Redis, CDN, browser cache |

Also check:
- Working examples in the same codebase — what does the same thing correctly?
- TODOS.md for related known issues
- Git log for prior fixes in the same area. Recurring bugs in the same files are an architectural smell, not a coincidence.

If the pattern isn't obvious, search the web for "{framework} {error type}" (sanitize first: strip hostnames, IPs, file paths, customer data).

### Phase 3: HYPOTHESIS

Form hypotheses ranked by likelihood. Test them one at a time.

**Why rank and isolate:** Ranking forces honest probability assessment — you test the most likely cause first, not the most interesting one. Testing one at a time means each test produces clear signal: confirmed or denied. Multiple simultaneous changes produce ambiguous results.

1. **Rank hypotheses:**
   ```
   H1 (80%): Token expires between redirect and callback
   H2 (15%): CORS header missing on callback endpoint
   H3 (5%): Browser caches stale auth response
   ```

   Ranking forces you to think about probability, not just possibility. Test the most likely hypothesis first.

2. **Test minimally.** One variable at a time. The smallest change that confirms or denies the hypothesis. Add a log statement, an assertion, or a debug output. Run the reproduction.

3. **If confirmed:** Proceed to Phase 4 (IMPLEMENT).

4. **If denied:** Move to the next hypothesis. Before forming a new one, return to Phase 1 and gather more evidence. Don't guess.

5. **3-strike rule:** If 3 hypotheses fail, STOP. This is not a failed hypothesis — this is a wrong architecture or a fundamentally misunderstood system. Present options:
   - Continue investigating with a new theory
   - Escalate for human review
   - Add instrumentation and wait for the next occurrence

**Red flags — if you catch yourself thinking any of these, STOP:**
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see what happens"
- "Add multiple changes at once, run tests"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- "One more fix attempt" after 2+ failures

### Phase 4: IMPLEMENT

Fix the root cause, not the symptom.

**Why root-cause-only:** Symptom fixes suppress the error at the crash site, but the underlying problem persists and will surface elsewhere — usually in a harder-to-diagnose form. A null check at the crash site doesn't fix the auth middleware that produced the null.

1. **Write a failing test first.** The simplest reproduction of the bug as an automated test. If no test framework exists, write a one-off script. The test MUST fail before the fix.

2. **Implement the minimal fix.** One change. One root cause addressed. No "while I'm here" refactoring. No bundled improvements.

3. **Verify the fix.** Test passes? Full suite passes? Original bug scenario resolved?

4. **Blast radius check.** If the fix touches more than 5 files, stop and ask. A bug fix that large usually means you're fixing the wrong thing.

**Why the 5-file limit:** A genuine root cause fix is usually localized — it changes one thing in one place. If you're touching 5+ files, you're likely fixing symptoms across multiple layers rather than the single source. Stop and re-investigate.

5. **Run the full test suite.** Paste the output. No regressions.

## Known Pitfalls

**Fixing the symptom instead of root cause.** The error was a `NullPointerException` on `user.getEmail()`. The fix added a null check: `user?.getEmail() ?? ""`. Two days later, a different code path crashed because `user` was null — the real bug was in the auth middleware that failed to populate the session.

*What went wrong:* The null pointer was a symptom. The root cause was upstream. The fix suppressed the error at the crash site instead of fixing where the null originated.

*Prevention:* Phase 1 Step 4 (trace data flow backward) exists specifically for this. Never fix at the crash site without tracing where the bad value comes from. Fix at the source.

**Testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously.** Three hypotheses were on the list. To save time, all three fixes were applied at once. The bug disappeared. Now none of the three fixes can be individually verified — which one actually fixed it? Is the fix correct, or did two wrong fixes cancel each other out?

*What went wrong:* Parallel hypothesis testing saves time in the moment but destroys diagnostic value. You learn nothing from a bulk fix.

*Prevention:* One hypothesis at a time. One change. One test. If the first fix works, you're done. If it doesn't, you still have a clean system for the next hypothesis. Phase 3 Step 2 says "one variable at a time" for a reason.

**Skipping Phase 1 because the cause "seems obvious."** A 500 error appeared right after a deploy. The obvious fix was to revert the deploy. After reverting, the error persisted — it was actually caused by a database migration that ran during deploy and wasn't included in the revert.

*What went wrong:* "Obvious" causes are usually the first thing that comes to mind, not the actual cause. Skipping investigation means missing the real problem.

*Prevention:* Complete Phase 1 (INVESTIGATE) every time, even when the cause seems obvious. The Iron Law exists because "obvious" causes are wrong often enough to justify the discipline.

**Not writing a regression test for the fix.** A race condition was found and fixed with a mutex. Six weeks later, a refactoring removed the mutex as "unnecessary overhead." The race condition returned in production.

*What went wrong:* The fix wasn't protected by a regression test. Without a test, future developers can't know why the code exists.

*Prevention:* Phase 4 Step 1 requires a failing test first. This test becomes the regression guard. A bug without a regression test is a bug waiting to happen again.
