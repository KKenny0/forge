Taku is a structured development workflow for coding agents. It turns vague prompts and overconfident code generation into a repeatable sprint:

```text
Think -> Plan -> Build -> Review -> Verify -> Reflect
```

This repository is the current `v0.2.0` skill pack. It includes:

- a top-level orchestrator in `SKILL.md`
- six focused phase skills under `skills/`
- an OpenClaw adapter in `platform/openclaw.md`
- reusable sprint templates in `templates/`
- promo assets in `promo/`

Taku is opinionated on purpose. It is built to prevent the failure modes that make AI-generated code expensive:

- coding before the problem is actually understood
- skipping tests because the implementation "looks right"
- treating debugging as random patching
- reviewing too late, or not reviewing the diff at all
- claiming completion without evidence

## Why Taku

Most AI coding workflows optimize for speed of output. Taku optimizes for speed to a reliable result.

Instead of one giant prompt, Taku gives the agent a sprint structure:

- **Think** when the request is still ambiguous
- **Plan** before touching code in non-trivial work
- **Build** against explicit tasks, with TDD, agent-owned mode selection, and optional wave-based parallelism
- **Review** against the actual diff, not hand-wavy intent
- **Verify** with fresh evidence, then debug the root cause instead of thrashing when checks fail
- **Reflect** only when there is something worth preserving

The result is a workflow that feels closer to a strong engineering lead than a code autocomplete tool.

## Current Shape

The repository has been simplified around six entry skills:

| Phase | Command | Current focus |
|------|------|------|
| Think | `/taku-think` | Adaptive design thinking with Quick, Design, and Explore modes |
| Plan | `/taku-plan` | Scope review, architecture review, UI design review, then executable `PLAN.md` |
| Build | `/taku-build` | Agent-chosen sequential / parallel / hybrid execution with TDD, wave visibility, and optional worktree isolation |
| Review | `/taku-review` | Diff-based code review with scope drift checks and fix-first posture |
| Verify | `/taku-debug` | Verification gate plus 4-phase root cause investigation when checks fail or behavior is broken |
| Reflect | `/taku-reflect` | Learning capture, retro, and skill codification when explicitly invoked |

This is not a bag of unrelated prompts. The skills are designed to hand work off from one phase to the next.

## What Makes It Different

### 1. It scales the process to the task

`/taku-think` is not blindly heavyweight. It auto-selects:

- **Quick** for clearly bounded changes
- **Design** for normal feature work
- **Explore** for idea-stage requests that are still too vague to implement

You get rigor when it matters, and less ceremony when it does not.

### 2. It treats planning as executable work

`/taku-plan` does more than write bullets. It forces:

- scope review before implementation
- architecture review before code spreads across modules
- UI design review only when there is actually UI
- tasks small enough to execute and verify

The goal is not a pretty plan. The goal is a plan the agent can actually land.

### 3. It makes build execution explicit

`/taku-build` now owns the execution decision and continues directly into BUILD once the plan is self-reviewed and still within the approved scope.

It supports three execution shapes:

- **Sequential** when the task is small or tightly coupled
- **Parallel** when tasks are independent and subagents can safely split the work
- **Hybrid** when execution is best expressed as waves: waves run in order, while tasks inside a wave may run in parallel

For `parallel` and `hybrid` runs, the agent is expected to show execution waves in user-facing updates:

- each wave gets a stable `wave-slug`
- each task keeps a stable `task-slug`
- preflight, progress, and completion updates show which wave ran and which task slugs it included

That means Taku can stay tight for small changes, accelerate larger sprints, and still keep the user oriented during execution.

### 4. It does not confuse "review" with "looks fine to me"

`/taku-review` reads the diff, checks base branch drift, and looks for failure patterns that tests often miss:

- unsafe query construction
- trust-boundary mistakes around LLM usage
- conditional side effects
- missing error handling
- scope drift between intent and delivery

### 5. It keeps verification and debugging distinct

Taku's fifth phase is a verification gate, not a second planning phase and not a vague "do some QA" instruction. The orchestrator owns the act of running the required checks. `/taku-debug` exists for the branch where those checks fail or the behavior is already broken.

That keeps the workflow honest:

- passing verification does not require a separate `/taku-test` skill
- failing verification immediately routes into `/taku-debug`
- the debug skill stays focused on root cause investigation instead of generic test running

Taku's debug flow is evidence-first:

1. investigate
2. pattern-match
3. rank hypotheses
4. verify the actual root cause

That prevents the most common AI bugfix loop: changing things until the output changes and calling it solved.

### 6. It keeps long-term memory under control

`/taku-reflect` is manual by design. Taku does not continuously write "learnings" just because something happened once.

Only user-approved patterns, pitfalls, preferences, and discoveries get preserved.

## Platform Status

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|------|------|------|
| Claude Code | Primary target | Canonical `SKILL.md` format and slash-command workflow |
| OpenClaw | Adapter included | Tool mapping documented in `platform/openclaw.md` |

The method is cross-platform even when the tooling details differ.

## Installation

### Claude Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KKenny0/Taku.git ~/.claude/skills/taku
```

Expose each phase as its own slash command:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
for phase in think plan build review debug reflect; do
  ln -s ~/.claude/skills/taku/skills/$phase ~/.claude/skills/taku-$phase
done
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
foreach ($phase in @("think","plan","build","review","debug","reflect")) {
  New-Item -ItemType Junction `
    -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\taku-$phase" `
    -Target "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\taku\skills\$phase"
}
```

Recommended entry points:

- `/taku-think` when the request is still fuzzy
- `/taku-plan` when design is approved and buildable tasks are needed
- `/taku-build` when `PLAN.md` is ready; the build agent should choose sequential / parallel / hybrid unless you explicitly override it
- `/taku-review` before shipping
- `/taku-debug` when something breaks
- `/taku-reflect` when a pattern is worth saving

### Migration Note

Older repo layouts used `skills/test/`, which caused two problems:

- the installed slash command could become `/taku-test` even though the actual skill name was `taku-debug`
- the phase semantics blurred verification and debugging into one label

The layout now uses `skills/debug/`. If you installed an older copy, recreate the symlink or junction so it points at `skills/debug/` and exposes `/taku-debug`.

### OpenClaw

Use the same repository as a skill pack, then follow the adapter notes in `platform/openclaw.md` for tool mapping and capability checks.

## Who This Is For

Taku fits teams or individuals who already know that raw code generation is not the bottleneck.

It is a strong fit when you want:

- more deterministic agent behavior on real engineering tasks
- better control over scope expansion
- explicit TDD and verification gates
- a way to split larger implementations without losing review discipline
- a reusable sprint shape across projects

It is a poor fit if you want "just write something fast and we will sort it out later". Taku is optimized for reliability and leverage, not maximum prompt minimalism.

## Inspiration

Taku stands on two strong foundations:

- **[Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)** by [Jesse Vincent](https://github.com/obra): engineering discipline, TDD enforcement, systematic debugging, and evidence-based completion
- **[gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack)** by [Garry Tan](https://github.com/garrytan): sprint thinking, product pressure-testing, QA methodology, and parallel execution patterns

Taku is not a clone of either. It is a narrower, more opinionated synthesis around a six-phase sprint.

## Roadmap Direction

The current repo already has the core sprint spine in place. The obvious next layer is not "more commands", but sharper execution quality:

- tighter handoff contracts between phases
- more explicit BUILD scheduling and wave visibility during long-running execution
- stronger review/test coverage for real-world repo changes
- better packaging and distribution ergonomics
- clearer examples of how to use Taku inside active product work
