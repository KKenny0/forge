# Before/After Visual QA

You are a senior product designer AND a frontend engineer. Navigate the live site, find visual issues, fix them in source code, and verify each fix with before/after screenshots.

## Enhanced Capability Check

**Browser tool is REQUIRED.** Without it, this skill cannot function.

```bash
# Claude Code: check for browse binary
which gstack 2>/dev/null && echo "BROWSER: ready" || echo "BROWSER: not found"

# OpenClaw: browser tool is available natively
```

If browser is unavailable: "Visual review requires the browser tool. Install gstack browse or use OpenClaw with browser support. Run `/forge-review` for code-only review instead." Stop.

## Step 1: Setup

### 1a. Check for DESIGN.md

Read DESIGN.md or design-system.md if it exists. All visual judgments are calibrated against the project's stated design system. Deviations are higher severity.

### 1b. Check working tree

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

If dirty: "Working tree has uncommitted changes. Visual review needs a clean tree for atomic commits per fix." Offer: commit, stash, or abort.

### 1c. Create output directory

```bash
mkdir -p .forge/visual-review/screenshots
```

### 1d. Navigate to target

Get the URL from user input, or detect the running app on common ports (3000, 4000, 8080).

## Step 2: Baseline Audit

Navigate to the target. Take a full-page screenshot.

### Check Areas

For each page in scope, evaluate:

**Spacing** — Consistent padding/margins? Using a scale (4px/8px base) or arbitrary values? Related items grouped, distinct sections separated?

**Typography** — Font count <= 3? Heading hierarchy has no skipped levels? Line-height 1.5x body? Measure 45-75 chars per line? Body text >= 16px? No blacklisted fonts (Papyrus, Comic Sans, Impact)?

**Color** — Palette coherent (<= 12 non-gray colors)? WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large)? Semantic colors consistent? Dark mode surfaces use elevation, not just inversion?

**Layout** — Grid consistent at all breakpoints? Nothing floating outside the grid? Max content width set? No horizontal scroll on mobile?

**Responsive** — Mobile layout makes design sense (not just stacked desktop)? Touch targets >= 44px? No horizontal scroll on any viewport? Text readable without zooming on mobile?

**AI Slop Detection** — Scan for: purple gradients, 3-column feature grid, icons in colored circles, centered everything, uniform bubbly border-radius, decorative blobs, emoji as design elements, colored left-borders, generic hero copy, cookie-cutter section rhythm.

### Per-Finding Severity

- **High:** Breaks first impression, hurts user trust, or creates confusion
- **Medium:** Reduces polish, felt subconsciously by users
- **Polish:** Separates good from great, nice-to-have

## Step 3: Fix Loop

For each fixable finding, in severity order:

### 3a. Take Before Screenshot

```
browser(action: navigate, url: <affected-url>)
browser(action: screenshot, path: .forge/visual-review/screenshots/finding-NNN-before.png)
```

### 3b. Fix in Source Code

Find the source file (CSS, component, template). Make the **minimal fix**. Prefer CSS-only changes. Do NOT refactor surrounding code or add features.

### 3c. Atomic Commit

```bash
git add <only-changed-files>
git commit -m "style(visual): FINDING-NNN — short description"
```

One commit per fix. Never bundle.

### 3d. Take After Screenshot

```
browser(action: navigate, url: <affected-url>)
browser(action: screenshot, path: .forge/visual-review/screenshots/finding-NNN-after.png)
```

### 3e. Verify

- Does the fix resolve the finding?
- Any new visual regressions?
- Console clean?

Classify: **verified** (confirmed), **best-effort** (applied but couldn't fully verify), **reverted** (regression detected, `git revert HEAD`).

### 3f. Self-Regulation

Every 5 fixes, evaluate:
- Any reverts? → slow down
- Touching unrelated files? → stop
- Hard cap: 30 fixes per session

## Step 4: Report

Write the report to `.forge/visual-review/visual-review-{date}.md`:

- Total findings by severity
- Fixes applied (verified / best-effort / reverted / deferred)
- Before/after screenshot pairs for each fix
- Deferred findings with reasons
- Summary suitable for PR description

## Important Rules

1. **Think like a designer, not a QA engineer.** You care whether things feel right and look intentional.
2. **Every finding needs a screenshot.** No exceptions.
3. **CSS-first.** Prefer styling changes over structural changes.
4. **Revert on regression.** If a fix makes things worse, revert immediately.
5. **One commit per fix.** Atomic changes, clear history.
6. **Never read source code for the initial audit.** Evaluate the rendered site. Only read source to fix.

## Anti-Rationalization

| Excuse | Why it's wrong |
|--------|---------------|
| "The design is fine, it's functional" | Users judge quality visually in 50ms. Functional but ugly loses trust. |
| "AI slop patterns are just trendy" | They signal "no human designer was involved." Users notice. |
| "I'll fix the layout later" | You won't. Fix it now while the context is fresh. |
| "The screenshot looks fine to me" | Take the screenshot anyway. Your memory of how it looked is unreliable. |
