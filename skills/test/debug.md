# forge-debug — 4-Phase Root Cause Investigation

Random fixes create new bugs. Systematic investigation finds root causes. This skill merges the best of Superpowers' systematic debugging with gstack's investigate workflow into a unified 4-phase process.

## The Iron Law

**NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST.**

Every fix that doesn't address root cause makes the next bug harder to find. If you haven't completed Phase 1 (INVESTIGATE), you cannot propose fixes. Period.

Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.

## The 4 Phases

### Phase 1: INVESTIGATE

Gather context before forming any hypothesis. This is evidence collection, not problem-solving.

1. **Read the error.** Stack traces, error messages, log output. Read them completely. Line numbers, file paths, error codes — all of it. The error message usually contains the answer.

2. **Reproduce consistently.** What are the exact steps? Does it happen every time? If not reproducible, gather more data. Don't guess at intermittent bugs.

3. **Check recent changes.**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -20 -- <affected-files>
   git diff HEAD~1 -- <affected-files>
   ```
   Was this working before? What changed? A regression means the root cause is in the diff.

4. **Trace data flow backward.** Where does the bad value originate? What called this function with the bad value? Keep tracing up until you find the source. Fix at source, not at symptom.

5. **Gather evidence in multi-component systems.** When the system has layers (API → service → database), add diagnostic logging at each boundary. Run once. See WHERE it breaks. Then investigate THAT layer.

Output: **Root cause hypothesis** — a specific, testable claim about what is wrong and why.

### Phase 2: PATTERN

Match the bug against known patterns before proposing solutions.

| Pattern | Signature | Where to look |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Race condition | Intermittent, timing-dependent | Shared state, concurrent access |
| Null propagation | TypeError, NoMethodError | Missing guards on optional values |
| State corruption | Inconsistent data, partial updates | Transactions, callbacks, hooks |
| Integration failure | Timeout, unexpected response | API boundaries, service calls |
| Config drift | Works locally, fails elsewhere | Env vars, feature flags, secrets |
| Stale cache | Shows old data | Redis, CDN, browser cache |

Also check:
- Working examples in the same codebase — what does the same thing correctly?
- TODOS.md for related known issues
- Git log for prior fixes in the same area. Recurring bugs in the same files are an architectural smell, not a coincidence.

If the pattern isn't obvious, search the web for "{framework} {error type}" (sanitize first: strip hostnames, IPs, file paths, customer data).

### Phase 3: HYPOTHESIS

Form hypotheses ranked by likelihood. Test them one at a time.

1. **Rank hypotheses:**
   ```
   H1 (80%): Token expires between redirect and callback
   H2 (15%): CORS header missing on callback endpoint
   H3 (5%): Browser caches stale auth response
   ```

   Ranking forces you to think about probability, not just possibility. Test the most likely hypothesis first.

2. **Test minimally.** One variable at a time. The smallest change that confirms or denies the hypothesis. Add a log statement, an assertion, or a debug output. Run the reproduction.

3. **If confirmed:** Proceed to Phase 4 (IMPLEMENT).

4. **If denied:** Move to the next hypothesis. Before forming a new one, return to Phase 1 and gather more evidence. Don't guess.

5. **3-strike rule:** If 3 hypotheses fail, STOP. This is not a failed hypothesis — this is a wrong architecture or a fundamentally misunderstood system. Present options:
   - Continue investigating with a new theory
   - Escalate for human review
   - Add instrumentation and wait for the next occurrence

**Red flags — if you catch yourself thinking any of these, STOP:**
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see what happens"
- "Add multiple changes at once, run tests"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- "One more fix attempt" after 2+ failures

### Phase 4: IMPLEMENT

Fix the root cause, not the symptom.

1. **Write a failing test first.** The simplest reproduction of the bug as an automated test. If no test framework exists, write a one-off script. The test MUST fail before the fix.

2. **Implement the minimal fix.** One change. One root cause addressed. No "while I'm here" refactoring. No bundled improvements.

3. **Verify the fix.** Test passes? Full suite passes? Original bug scenario resolved?

4. **Blast radius check.** If the fix touches more than 5 files, stop and ask. A bug fix that large usually means you're fixing the wrong thing.

5. **Run the full test suite.** Paste the output. No regressions.

## Output: Debug Report

```
DEBUG REPORT
═════════════════════════════════════════
Symptom:         [what the user observed]
Root cause:      [what was actually wrong]
Hypotheses:      [H1: confirmed, H2: denied, H3: untested]
Fix:             [what changed, file:line references]
Evidence:        [test output, reproduction showing fix works]
Regression test: [file:line of new test]
Status:          DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED
═════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Status

- **DONE** — Root cause found, fix applied, regression test written, all tests pass.
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — Fixed but can't fully verify (intermittent bug, requires staging).
- **BLOCKED** — Root cause unclear after 3 hypotheses. Escalated.
